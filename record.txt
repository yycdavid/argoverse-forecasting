- What is the problem?
    - Is timestep prediction the reason?
        - Change eval with true time step (Done)
            - 3.97 -> 3.1, 9.8 -> 7.8
        - True v: 2.3, 4.8
        - True c: 3.5, 8.5
        - True v + t: 1.3, 2.7
        - True t + c: 2.8, 6.2
        - True v + c: 1.8, 3.1
        - True v + t + c: 0.4, 0.48
        - Seems that velocity > time > centerline in causing problems
        - Also a discrepency between loss and ades
    - Why centerline loss and velocity loss not as good as 1 segment?
        - Eval on different segments, see difference (30')
        - Visualize predictions (1h)
- How to solve?
    - Reduce max epoch
    - Eval every epoch
    - t_gt * (v - v_gt)^2
- Is low data regime better?
    - Both ours and baseline lSTM
        - Ours (1h)
        - Baseline (2h)

0923 TODO:
- Try new loss on v, run (30')
- Set up low data regime, run (3h)
